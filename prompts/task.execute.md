# Task Execute

Stable task execution entrypoint.

Metadata:
- scope: task
- stage: execute
- recommended_model_class: open_model
- escalation_model_class: frontier_model

## Instructions

Read the file `prompts/tasks.next_and_implement.md` and follow all steps in it exactly.

Treat this prompt as packet-first workflow execution, not permission to start coding immediately.
Before any code change, confirm there is an active task packet on disk or generate one through the workflow steps in `prompts/tasks.next_and_implement.md`.
If the workflow state still requires task planning or no packet exists yet, stop and route through the packet-creation path before implementation.

Do not summarize or abbreviate the steps. Execute the full prompt.
